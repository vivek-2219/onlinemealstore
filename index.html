                Pizza is an Italian dish consisting of a usually round, flattened base of leavened wheat-based dough
                topped with tomatoes, cheese, and often various other ingredients, which is then baked at a high
                temperature, traditionally in a wood-fired oven.

                A hamburger is a food, typically considered a sandwich, consisting of one or more cooked patties of
                ground meat, usually beef, placed inside a sliced bread roll or bun. The patty may be pan fried,
                grilled, smoked or flame broiled. Hamburgers are often served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion,
                pickles, bacon, or chiles; condiments such as ketchup, mustard, mayonnaise.
